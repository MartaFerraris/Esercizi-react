Create a new React application with vite and remove all the files within the src folder. 
Inside src folder create a Hello function component that renders the "Hello, World!" 
message within an h2 tag. Write a function component called App that renders the Hello component within a div tag. 
Create a new index.jsx file within the src folder and render the App component using the createRoot function and 
the render method on the created root's object. Start the application with the npm run dev command and 
open the application in your browser (the default location is http://localhost:5173).
